# A11y Example App

A11y (a numeronym for Accessibility) is an open source app to showcase to developers, designers or anyone in the tech field what Apple offers in terms of accessibility from UI components to APIs. There is no extra fluff of custom app themes  or custom implementation. I try to keep each component as true to out of the box as possible while also making each UI component accessible. 

For the designers you can see (or hear) what native components are available and what they provide with minimal to no customization (straight out of the box).  For developers you can see what APIs are available to use as well as how to use them, and an easy simple app to use as a playground.
